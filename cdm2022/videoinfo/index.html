  <p>I knew from the start of the project that I wanted to include the video of Frank O’Hara reading his poem, which happens to be one of my favorites, because I think it’s pretty cool that I have access to that video at all, with how long ago it was recorded. From starting with the O’Hara video, I brought in more elements that connected to it. I included the Billie Holiday song because its lyrics are similar in theme to the poem, and because one of O’Hara’s most famous poems is a tribute to her death. I found colorized footage of NYC in the sixties, and included it because it was O’Hara’s stomping ground, and because I think it’s very cool to see people going about their lives fifty years ago just as we do now. The gap between now and then is not as large as people think it is. I think most of the elements of this project were largely included for myself, making connections between all sorts of ideas and media that someone not as familiar with the poem and its backstory wouldn’t know. However, I think the old song and old footage, combined with the grainy film effects, get across the connection I am trying to make between this poem written in 1960 and my current life. I included pictures that I have taken myself that relate to the subject, which is spending time with the people you love.</p>

  <p>On the technical side, I was already somewhat familiar with the software of Adobe Premier going in, but over the course of this project I grew more familiar with options I had not explored before, such as effects. I learned from tutorials how to apply the old film grain to videos, and I learned how to crop videos and fade in and out audio. One thing that I was not super happy with was the transitions between the song and poem portions of the video, but I wasn’t sure how to do that in a way I would like with my current skill set. I’m most proud of the inclusion of my own pictures of statues and my friends. I was happy that I could incorporate some of my personal pictures to tie the poem’s audio to my own life. I also love making things happen on audio cues when editing videos. I love zooming into the timeline and planning out transitions between images down to the nanosecond. I’m happy with the thought I put into the video and images I included, even if most people won’t get the references.</p>

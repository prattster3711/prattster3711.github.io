  <p>When coming up with the Imaginary App, I had the starting point of a very nice transit app user interface that a friend shared a screenshot of a while back. It’s kind of niche, but I really love a nice interface design, so that one stuck with me. Originally, when I thought this project involved designing a user interface, I wanted to base it off of that app, and it got so many ideas rolling that by the time I figured out that that wasn’t the point of the project, I had a lot to work with. Additionally, in my computer science classes, we talk about the Traveling Salesman, which involves finding the shortest route between multiple points. I thought about how things like Google Maps’s algorithms are taken for granted, how we assume that it’s basically automatic for computers to find the shortest and best route to a particular place. It’s not a struggle for the computer, but it does take computation and “effort”.</p>
  <p>Some rejected ideas included a chess app where, occasionally, the chess pieces would not go where you told them to; a calculator app that has a certain chance of being wrong; and a movie app where you are provided a selection of new and two year old movies, and if you choose a new one you can buy tickets for it and if you choose an old one the app mocks you for being out of touch. I ended up choosing the transit app because I thought it had the most going on and could send a more poignant message. My transit app is like a regular transit app with some features removed, which would frustrate users and draw to their attention the work that goes into routing algorithms and how they take for granted knowing exactly where something is and where they’re going. Not too long ago, that wasn’t an option.</p>
  <p>When I was building upon this app, I somewhat wanted to include a feature where other users could drop location pins for things they thought were cool or worth seeing, and the app would account for that when making routes and take you by those densely pinned spaces. However, I thought this idea was too cool/useful for a bad app, so I scrapped it. The idea of the app now centers more around making people more aware of the algorithms behind an app, and more aware of what surrounds them in the place where they live.</p>
  <p>Originally, I wanted an image of something like a childish treasure map with loops and doubling back to illustrate that the journey provided by this app would not be a straight line. When I couldn’t find an image that I liked, I decided to try something else. I took a screenshot of my google maps (you can see that I have the restaurants I’d like to visit flagged lol) in Pittsburgh and drew a route from the Carnegie Music Hall to the Heinz Hall for the Performing Arts, tracing the roads in a particularly redundant fashion. I think that it will emphasize to the reader that the point of this app isn’t to get you from point A to point B via an easy route, but, for better or for worse, it meanders. I think it will make the reader say, “well, why can’t it take me directly there?” to which I would ask, why can Google Maps actually take you directly to where you want to go? Why do we get so frustrated when a journey is prolonged, even if we’re not particularly in any sort of rush?</p>
  <p>In the real world, this app would not be preferred over Google Maps. It would be used for people who have time to spare and would maybe like to get out into their community a little bit, drive down streets they’ve never seen before but are only a few miles from their home. I want people to actually see more of their community. I think it would make the user more patient. I envision this app not providing any sense of how long the journey would take, so there would be less pressure to meet a certain deadline. At every turn, you would think, what on Earth brought me here? What in the algorithm of this app decided that this is a good place to drive? To make it more filled with friction, this app would not let you zoom out far to see where you will be heading once you’ve started moving, so each turn would be a surprise and you would have to keep checking back at your map, particularly if the app is taking you somewhere you’ve never been before so you don’t know how to navigate. I hope this would make the user more aware of their reliance on electronic navigation, and how they can’t afford to look away from it for too long without getting completely lost. Users might push against it by looking closely at the map before starting the journey to get a sense of where they might be, or having a larger, zoomable map open in another transit app to check where they are. These are both a large effort of either memory or multitasking (which wouldn’t be safe while driving anyway), so I don’t think this app could be easily minimized.</p>

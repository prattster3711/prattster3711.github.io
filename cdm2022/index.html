      <h2><center>Video</center></h2>

      <p>My video combines video of NYC in the sixties, music by Billie Holiday, and Frank O'Hara's poem "Having a Coke With You."</p>

    <p> Some of my thoughts not included in the Statement of Goals and Choices:
        <p>- I included a NYC clip with a Coke ad in the background before O’Hara starts reading his poem</p>
        <p>- I really liked being able to include the clip from Ferris Bueller’s day off, that’s one of my favorite movies</p>
        <p>- In the quick series of portraits flashing, the man with the apple in front of his face, Magritte’s Son of Man, is one of my favorite paintings</p>
        <p>- The man dancing in the ballet clip is Vincent Warren, who is actually the subject of O’Hara’s poem</p>
        <p>- The Nude Descending the Staircase clip was included in place of a still image of the painting because I thought it was neat :)</p>
        <p>- The statue in the pictures at the very end of the video was made by Marino Marini, who was mentioned in the poem; I didn’t know that until making this video, when I looked up the name, saw the statue, and thought “hey, that looks familiar!” I was excited that I could use the pictures of my friends recreating the statue as a tie in on the sculptor</p>

<!-- We'll need to do some more work in this section, but to do so, we'll need to make some changes on your style.css file. Developers refer to this division as a "Hero Block," but we will refer to it as a "Wide Image."  Think carefully about the image you select and how it might serve a sybolic function in your life. Ulmer refers to these kinds of symbolic images as "wide images" in that they often repeat over and over in our lifetime. We will similarly repeat this image at the end of your Electrate Infuego composition to establish a motif in this web document.-->

<!--The hero image is controlled on the style.css page. To replace this image, simply place a .jpg file in the same file folder (directory) as this project and name it hero.jpg. Alternatively, if you are working with a .png, you will need to open the style.css file using your text editor, and change the file type from .jpg to .png. Browsers will only work with .jpg, .jpeg, or .png imgaes. Since hero images need to stretch across the screen, typically you will want to select an image 1200px in width to allow quick load time yet avoid pixilation.-->

<!--In our first exploration of discourse, we're going to think about the wider characteristics or themes of our field or future career. In academia, we do a lot of work narrowing our interest to arrive at a career or profession, often reducing our field to a level of operation or an act. Instead, I would like you to think more broadly about the "wider themes" you associate with your field or future career and its larger significance in improving our world. Yes...improving the world. Thinking back, where do you see exposure to those same "wider themes" in your own life? Those ah-ha moments, lessons, examples, tools, passions, or qualities that suggested this career path to you? Replace the content between <h2> and </h2> that begins with "Lorem ipsum."-->

<div class="textblock">
  <h2>Field or Career</h2>

  <p>I am in Pitt's School of Computing and Information to earn a degree in Information Science. I enjoy programming, but IS offers more classes focused on human-centered design, and I prefer a field with more focus on the human component of human-computer interaction. I was originally between the Digitigal Narrative and Interaction Design (DNID), Computer Science, and Information Science majors. IS, for me, strikes the perfect balance between the humanities presented in a DNID major and the systems concepts presented in a CS major. <a href=https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp>laborum</a>.</p>

<!--Show us. Find those beautiful, meaningful "family" photos and pictures of your place (only you can define family). If you are concerned about issues of privacy, you can always use stock images, or get creative. Add these photos to your project folder, making sure the files end in .jpg or .png and replace the names in the grid code below. You can add more images if you wish, or subtract...you might also need to move content around to achieve balance. See what happens – sometimes you have to be playful to find the purpose of things. Since these images are smaller, you will want to resize your images to less than 600px in width. This will improve load time and thus general accesibility. Don't forget to add alt="text"-->

<!--Now we are moving into the kinds of media that contributes to your everyday discourse. This might sound weird, but Ulmer argues that media has actually contributed a great deal to who you are as a person, how you language yourself, and even how you move through the world and interact with others. So, let's take some time to explore this discourse area. You have the opportunity to add video content or other significant media content. You might also add images to this section (see the bottom of this sheet for directions on how to add elements) perhaps adding a photo grid like the one you did for the "Family" section. Experiment.
